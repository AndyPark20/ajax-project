I CALLED TOYOTA SERVICE AND EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM AND HE ARRANGED  A TOW TRUCK PICK UP MY CAR BUT TOLD ME THAT SINCE IT WAS 5PM THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT UNTIL THE MORNING. THE NEXT MORNING THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR STARTED WITHOUT INCIDENT AND ALTHOUGH THEY RAN EXTENSIVE TESTING THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG. THEY WANTED ME TO COME AND PICK IT UP BUT I REFUSED STATING THAT THERE DEFINETLY WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS CAR AND THAT I WAS JUST GLAD THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN EARLIER IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS ON I-95 GOING 80 MPH WITH A SEMI IN BACK OF ME. I ALSO TOLD THEM THAT I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH ON MY OWN AT PRIUSONLINE AND YAHOO PRIUS FORUM AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND IN MOST CASES IT WAS FOUND TO BE DUE TO A FEW CODES THAT NEEDED TO BE UPDATED IN THE CARS COMPUTER. I THEN ASKED THEM TO CHECK THESE SPECIFIC CODES. WHEN I CALLED BACK THE NEXT DAY THEY SAID THAT THEY RAN THE CODES AND FOUND NOTHING AND HAD TAKEN THE CAR FOR A LONG DRIVE BUT HAD NO PROBLEMS. THEY RELEASED IT TO ME AND IT HAS DRIVEN JUST AS PERFECTLY FOR ME AS IT DID UP UNTIL THE 1 SECOND BEFORE IT'S ENGINE QUIT WITHOUT WARNING.

ALSO THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START AGAIN BECAUSE THE BATTERIES RUNNING THE ELECTRIC MOTOR WERE NOT ASSISTING IN THE DRIVE OF THE CAR AS DESIGNED.  I NOTICED A NOTE ON A WEB SITE THIS EVENING THAT INDICATED THE CAR WOULD NOT RUN WHEN THE BATTERIES WERE BELOW A 20% CHARGE.  IF THIS IS CORRECT, IT WOULD FIT IN WITH MY THEORY.  THE SHIFT LEVER NEEDS TO BE HARDER TO MOVE SO THAT ACCIDENTAL CHANGES SUCH AS I EXPERIENCED WOULD BE PREVENTED.  IF THIS IS TOO EXPENSIVE, MAYBE A CHEAPER WAY TO FIX TGHE PROBLEM WOULD BE FOR AN ALARM LIGHT OR AUDIBLE SIGNAL TO GO ON WHEN THE BATTERY PROPULSION HAD BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG UNASSISTED BY THE GASOLINE MOTOR.

I BROUGHT THE CAR IN THE FOLLOWING MORNING (SATURDAY MARCH 26,2005) TO CHECK  OUT THE PROBLEM.THEY HAD THE CAR ALL DAY AND STILL COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHY THE CAR WAS STALLING. SINCE I WAS SCHEDULE TO BE AWAY THE FOLLOWING WEEK (TRIP TO LAS VEGAS). I GAVE PERMISSION FOR TECHS TO KEEP CAR ALL WEEK IF NECESSARY. ON MONDAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I RECIEVED A CALL FROM TECH AT MY HOTEL THAT THEY HAD FIXED THE PROBLEM. HE CLAIMED IT WAS A MISFIRE IN #1 CYCLINDER. SO THEY REPLACED SPARK PLUG #1. HOWEVER, HE ALSO TOLD ME NOT GET THE CAR ENGINE WET. HE WARNED THAT IF I EVER RETURNED THE CAR WITH A WET ENGINE AGAIN THAT MY WARRANTY WOULD BE VOIDED. I TOLD HIM THAT I NEVER OPEN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND THAT I WOULD NEVER INTENTIONALLY PUT WATER DIRECTLY ON THE ENGINE. PARTICULLARY ON SUCH A SOPHISTICATED CAR SUCH AS A HYBRID. IN THE PAST 10,000 MILES THAT I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE I HAVE TAKEN IT THROUGH THE CAR WASH A TOTAL OF THREE TIMES.I PICKED UP THE CAR UPON MY RETURN FROM LAS VEGAS ON FRIDAY APRIL 1,2005.

WHEN I BACKED OUT FAR ENOUGH INTO THE TRAFFIC LANE, I REALIZED THAT TRAFFIC WAS COMING. I NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY TO AVOID GETTING HIT. I QUICKLY MOVED THE SHIFT LEVER TO “D” AND ACCELERATED. THE CAR LURCHED BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS. I HIT THE BRAKE AND QUICKLY BUT CAREFULLY SHIFTED TO “D” AGAIN. APPROACHING TRAFFIC WAS NOW ALMOST AT MY LOCATION. I ACCELERATED AGAIN BUT THE CAR LURCHED BACKWARDS, NOT FORWARDS, AGAIN. THE CAR HAD IGNORED BOTH INPUTS FROM ME AND REMAINED IN REVERSE.\r\n\r\nLUCKILY THE APPROACHING TRAFFIC SLOWED TO AVOID CRASHING INTO ME, GIVING ME TIME TO SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY MOVE THE SHIFT LEVER TO “D.” THIS TIME THE CAR MOVED FORWARD.\r\n\r\nI CAN EASILY SHIFT THE LEVER TOO QUICKLY, WHICH RESULTS IN NO GEAR CHANGE. TOYOTA SAID THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION IS NORMAL FOR THE PRIUS.\r\n\r\nALSO, THERE IS A COLUMN-MOUNTED STALK TOO CLOSE TO THE DASH-MOUNTED GEAR SHIFT LEVER. IT IS EASY TO MOMENTARILY PUT YOUR HAND ON THE WRONG STALK WHEN TRYING TO SHIFT GEARS.\r\n\r\nFINALLY, THE CAR LOUDLY BEEPS WHENEVER REVERSE IS SELECTED.

THE CAR LOST POWER AND I HAD TO LIMP IT HOME. THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION DISPLAY FOR THE BATTERY PACK SHOWED ONE RED BAR AND THE FUEL GAUGE HAD TWO BARS LEFT. \r\n\r\nI CALLED TOYOTA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WHICH PROMPTLY DISPATCHED A TOW TRUCK AND DELIVERED THE CAR TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER DID A DIAGNOSTIC TEST THE FOLLOWING MORNING, FRIDAY, 4/8/05, AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I GOT WAS THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSSUE WITH 2 BARS OF FUEL LEFT AND THE CAUSE WAS THAT THE ENGINE SUCKED IN AIR WITH STOPS OR TURNS. \r\n\r\nIS THERE A FURTHER EXPLANATION OR FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM?

I MANAGED TO AVOID BEING REAR-ENDED , PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD USING BATTERY POWER, SHUT THE BATTERY POWER OFF, AND CONSULTED THE OWNER'S MANUAL. APPROXIMATELY 10-15 MINUTES PRIOR, THE ADD FUEL LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE FUEL INDICATOR DISPLAYED A SINGLE BAR. HAVING DRIVEN THE VEHICLE FOR THE PAST 8300 MILES, MY WIFE INFORMED ME THAT WE HAD ABOUT 2 GALLONS OF GAS, AND COULD EASILY TRAVEL ANOTHER FIFTY MILES. THE TEMPERATURE WAS NEAR 90 DEGREES. I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND CHOSE TO DRIVE IT OFF THE INTERSTATE. WE TRAVELED 2.5 MILES AND COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS THE BATTERY DEPLETED. I MANAGED TO SLOWLY DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO A GAS STATION AND REFUELED. THE FUEL TANK COULD ONLY ACCOMMODATE 8.1 GALLONS OF FUEL; IT HOLDS 11.7.  ONCE REFUELED, THE WARNING SIGNALS DISAPPEARED AFTER 30 SECONDS, AND WE DROVE HOME. MY WIFE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, JOE HEITZ TOYOTA IN CLARKSVILLE, TN, THE NEXT DAY FOR AN EVALUATION. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE COMPUTER INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE RAN OUT OF FUEL. SINCE THERE OBVIOUSLY WAS FUEL IN THE TANK, I PRESSED THE SERVICE MANAGER FOR ANSWERS. BY THE END OF THE DAY AND AFTER CONSULTING WITH PRIUS TECHNICAL FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT THE FUEL BLADDER MAY HAVE COLLAPSED OVER THE SENDING MODULE THEREBY SIGNALING THE CAR'S COMPUTER THAT IT WAS OUT OF GAS, WHICH CAUSED IT TO SHUT DOWN. HE SAID TOYOTA IS LOOKING INTO THE PROBLEM AND PROVIDED A LAME SOLUTION; REFUEL THE VEHICLE BEFORE IT GETS TOO LOW. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE ANSWER AND I IMPLORE THE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY ANOMALY.

I BELIEVE THE \"STALLING\" IS INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED INTO THE SOFTWARE TO PROTECT THE TRANSMISSION. I THINK A DESIGN DECISION INTENDED TO PROTECT THE CAR IS PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK.  \r\n MY EARLY 2005 PRIUS HAS \"STALLED\" TWICE: ONCE ON THE FREEWAY AT 80 MPH WHEN I HAD TO JAM ON THE BRAKES (SOMEONE CUT ME OFF) AND AGAIN ON SURFACE STREETS AT 30 MPH WHEN I FLOORED IT TO ACCELERATE SUDDENLY. IN EACH CASE THE TRANSMISSION'S INTERNAL COMPONENTS WOULD BE UNDER TREMENDOUS STRAIN UNLESS IT DISENGAGED. IN EACH CASE ALL LIGHTS, HEADLIGHTS, INDICATORS STAYED ON, THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT CAME ON, THE CAR CONTINUED COASTING (AS IF PUT IN NEUTRAL), AND THE CAR WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO THE THROTTLE AND THE GEAR SHIFT. (IN NEITHER CASE DID I HIT THE GEAR SHIFT NOR POWER BUTTON BEFORE THE \"STALL\"). IN BOTH CASES I COASTED TO A SAFE SPOT (TRY CROSSING FIVE LANES OF 70+ MPH FREEWAY TRAFFIC AT NIGHT WHILE COASTING). ONLY AFTER PARKING, TURNING OFF POWER, AND RESTARTING POWER WOULD THE CAR OPERATE...AT WHICH POINT IT OPERATED FINE. DEALER COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG...IN FACT THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS TWO DAYS AFTER MY 30,000 MILE SERVICE!  THEY APPARENTLY TOOK NO ACTION REGARDING THE CONCERN I EXPRESSED TO THE SERVICE REP WITH RESPECT TO STALLING...HE ASSURED ME THEY WOULD CHECK FOR ALL AVAILABLE SOFTWARE UPDATES, BUT CORPORATE TOLD ME TODAY THERE IS AT LEAST ONE UPDATE (RELATING TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM) WHICH WAS NOT DOWNLOADED, SO APPARENTLY THE DEALER IS NOT RESPONDING TO THIS LIFE-THREATENING CONCERN.  \r\n \r\nI CALLED CORPORATE TODAY TO START A \"CASE\" AND WAS TOLD THEY ARE UNAWARE THAT THIS IS A RECURRENT ISSUE.

BY THAT, I MEAN THAT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.  I AM NOT AWARE OF WHAT THE INSTRUMENTS INDICATED AS I WAS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE TRAFFIC (FOR MORE DETAILS - I SENT A VERY DETAILED E-MAIL ABOUT THE FAILURE TO OUR DEALER CULLIGAN TOYOTA, AMHERST, NY ON JULY 24, 2005 - I HAVE ALSO SENT ADDITIONAL FOLLOW-UP E-MAILS TO CULLIGAN SINCE THAT DATE. ).  AS A RESULT OF THE JULY 24 MESSAGE, I ARRANGED TO LEAVE THE CAR WITH CULLIGAN TOYOTA SERVICE ADVISOR STEPHEN DESOTELL ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 27, 2005 TO BE CHECKED OUT.   AT ABOUT 3:00 P.M. ON JULY 27 STEPHEN CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT THEY HAD CHECKED OUT THE CAR AND COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT IN ANY WAY Â¿¿ MECHANICAL OR COMPUTER OR ANYTHING.  HE SAID THAT IT HAD THE LATEST SOFTWARE AND THAT THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING SERVICE BULLETINS OF RECALLS FOR THE CAR AND THAT IN HIS DISCUSSION WITH TOYOTA, IT WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT I MUST HAVE INADVERTENTLY HIT THE Â¿¿POWERÂ¿ BUTTON ON THE DASHBOARD - OR WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. SUBSEQUENTLY I TESTED THE CAR AND FOUND THAT I COULD NOT TURN OFF OUR PRIUS BY DELIBERATELY PUSHING OR HOLDING THE POWER BUTTON IN.  BY CALL TO THE ABOVE SERVICE ADVISOR SINCE THEN, HE LATER CONFIRMED THAT THIS WAS CORRECT - THAT IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCIDENTALLY OR DELIBERATELY SHUT ANY PRIUS DOWN BY HITTING THE POWER BUTTON WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION UNDER POWER.  WE HAVE HAD NO REPEAT OF THIS EVENT.  HOWEVER, THE FAILURE HAPPENED TO US IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN I WAS IN THE PASSING LANE WITH TRAFFIC ON MY RIGHT AND ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON MY LEFT AND A HIGH-SPEED CAR APPROACHING ME FROM THE REAR - AND I HAD NOWHERE TO STEER TO!

IT WAS TOWED.  I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND WAS SENT TO A REPAIR FACILITY.  AFTER SEVERAL DAYS THEY GOT MY CAR, BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START, TOWED IT TO A TOYOTA SHOP.  IT SAT THERE FOR 10 DAYS, UNTIL I CALLED, THEN IT WAS SENT BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  IT TOOK 6 MORE WEEKS FOR THE CAR TO BE REPAIRED.  ONE DELAY WAS IN GETTING THE SEAT-BELT, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH THE SEAT, BUT DID NOT.  IT HAD TO BE SHIPPED FROM JAPAN (I WAS TOLD).  AFTER THE REPAIR WAS DONE, 9 WEEKS AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE CAR WOULD NOT START.  IT WAS TOWED TO ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  TWO WEEKS LATER, I AM TOLD THAT A WIRING HARNESS WAS THE PROBLEM.  THIS HAS TO BE SHIPPED FROM JAPAN, AND THE EXPECTED DATE OF ARRIVAL IS 1-11-2006.\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE, I HAVE NOT HAD MY CAR FOR NEARLY 3 MONTHS.  MY INSURANCE PAID FOR 30 DAYS OF A RENTAL CAR (I WAITED A WEEK TO GET THE RENTAL CAR), THEN I PAID FOR ANOTHER 4 WEEKS.  I HAVE NOTIFIED TOYOTA 2 TIMES ABOUT THIS SITUATION.  I HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE I HAVE A \"SPECIAL\" CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE CARD.  THIS CARD ONLY SEEMS TO BE GOOD FOR PURCHASES, AND NOT FOR ACTUAL ASSISTANCE.\r\n\r\nI THINK PRIUS OWNERS NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR CARS CAN ONLY BE REPAIRED AT A FEW LOCATIONS, AND MOST DEALERSHIPS CAN NOT REPAIR THEM PROPERLY.\r\nADDITIONALLY, I THINK THE CAR HAS A SIGNIFICANT BLINDS POT, AS I AM FREQUENTLY SURPRISED BY OTHER CARS SUDDENLY APPEARING.  *JB",

I FELT BAD THE DEALER WOULD NOT OWN UP TO THE PROBLEM.  I KNOW I DIDN'T ROTATE TIRES AS OFTEN AS I SHOULD HAVE, BUT I HAVE A MERCURY AND FORD THAT HAVE THEIR TIRES ROTATED ABOUT EVER 15,000 MILES. I GET GREAT TIRE WEAR AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.  BY TIME I GOT THE ALIGNMENT AND THE TIRES I WAS INTO IT OVER $500.(THAT'S A LOT OF GAS).  THE TIRE DEALERS SAID IT WAS THE CAR MORE THAN THE TIRES.   I HAVE HAD TOYOTAS IN THE PAST AND WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS ONE.   I HAVE SORT OF LOST CONFIDENCE IN THIS CAR AND EVEN DISCUSSED GETTING A DIFFERENT CAR WITH THE DEALER BUT THEY WERE UNWILLING TO DISCUSS THAT.  *NM",

DURING THAT TIME THE MOTOR HAS SHUT DOWN, LOSING SUBSTANTIAL FORWARD MOMENTUM. IF THE SECOND WHEEL SLIPS,THE PROCESS IS REPEATED GIVING THE ORIGINAL WHEEL POWER. THE 1 SECOND TIME INTERVAL OCCURS AGAIN AND MORE FORWARD MOMENTUM IS LOST. ON A SLIPPERY HILL, THIS BASICALLY STOPS THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE AUTO VERY QUICKLY. IF BOTH WHEELS CONTINUE TO SLIP,THE AUTO JUST SITS THERE , WITH THE ELECTRIC MOTOR STARTING AND STOPPING AS THE POWER IS SWITCHED BETWEEN FRONT WHEELS. IF THERE ARE CARS BEHIND YOURS, THEN BACKING UP IS IMPOSSIBLE. IF THE WIFE AND KIDS ARE IN A BAD NEIGHBOR HOOD AND THIS HAPPENS,THAT COULD MEAN REAL TROUBLE.\r\nTHE CONDITION IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. ALL THE PRIUS'  SHOULD BE RECALLED AND THE TRACTION CONTROL REPROGRAMMED TO ALLOW REDUCED POWER TO THE SLIPPING WHEEL, NOT ZERO POWER. THIS WILL TEND TO MAINTAIN FORWARD MOMENTUM AND KEEP THE MOTOR FROM SHUTTING DOWN.  I SPOKE TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER AND THEY CLAIMED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE DESIGN FLAW.  *NM\r\n",

THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY DUE TO A WOEFULLY INADEQUATE JACK SUPPLIED BY TOYOTA WITH MY 2005 PRIUS. THE JACK BENT WHILE TRYING TO LIFT THE AUTOMOBILE.  LIFTING THE CAR WAS ATTEMPTED THREE TIMES BY SLIGHTLY REPOSITIONING THE BASE OF THE JACK.  IT WAS FINALLY NECESSARY TO BRACE THE JACK WITH PIECES OF WOOD IN ORDER TO LIFT THE AUTOMOBILE HIGH ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED TIRE.  THE PONY SPARE HAD TO BE DEFLATED TO GET IT INTO PLACE IN ORDER TO APPLY THE LUG NUTS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE JACK TO LIFT THE CAR FOR ADEQUATE CLEARANCE.  LUCKILY I HAD AN ELECTRIC AIR PUMP ON BOARD TO RE-INFLATE THE PONY SPARE.  THE ENTIRE OPERATION TOOK 1 HOUR 45 MINUTES.  \r\nSEVERAL POINTS SHOULD BE MADE.  I AM NOT AN IDIOT.  I HAVE CHANGED FLATS PREVIOUSLY.  THE JACK WAS NEW AS SUPPLIED WITH THE PRIUS PURCHASED IN LATE 2004; IT HAD NEVER BEEN USED.  THE TIRE CHANGE OCCURRED ON AN ALMOST COMPLETELY FLAT SURFACE.  THE BASE OF THE JACK WAS RESTING ON CEMENT.  THE WEATHER WAS GOOD; NO ICE, SNOW, WIND OR RAIN.  MY LIGHTING WAS GOOD.  I LIFTED THE PRIUS WHERE INDICATED.  I HAD BLOCKED THE REAR TIRES WITH BRICKS PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING TO LIFT THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS NOT LOADED WITH ADDITIONAL WEIGHT.\r\n\r\nI AM VERY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE JACK THAT WAS SUPPLIED WITH THE PRIUS.  AS A CONSUMER, ONE WOULD NOT THINK OF INSPECTING SUCH BASIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO DECIDING ON AN AUTOMOBILE.  THE AUTOMOBILE COULD HAVE EASILY SLIPPED FROM THE JACK DURING THE TIRE CHANGING OPERATION.  SEVERE INJURY COULD OCCUR TO THE INDIVIDUAL(S) OR THE VEHICLE ITSELF.  MY FATHER RECENTLY BOUGHT A PRIUS AT MY SUGGESTION PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  I NOW FEAR FOR HIS SAFETY KNOWING HOW INADEQUATE THE JACK IS THAT IS SUPPLIED WITH THIS VEHICLE.  *JB\r\n",

I WAS THEN ADVISED BY SERVICE MANAGER THAT THE REAR BRAKES (DRUM) WERE FILLED WITH BRAKE DUST.\r\n\r\nI FIND IT INCONSISTENT THAT THE LARGE ACCUMULATION OF BRAKE DUST DID NOT EXIST ABOUT 8,000 MILES AGO WHEN THE GRABBING CONDITION FIRST PRESENTED AFTER I HAD DRIVEN WITHOUT THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 21,000 MILES.

MY HUSBAND TRIED TO GO ONTO THE SHOULDER (PROBABLY HIT SOME GRAVEL) AND THE CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL. IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO MY EXPERIENCE.

THE MFD INITIALIZED TO THE MPG SCREEN BUT HAD UNUSUAL COLORS.  I ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE THE DISPLAY SCREEN BY SELECTING THE AUDIO, CLIMATE, DISPLAY, AND INFO BUTTONS BUT TO NO AVAIL.  THE SCREEN WOULD GO BLANK AND THEN SHOW THE ?PRIUS HYBRID? INITIALIZING SCREEN AND THEN RETURN TO THE MPG SCREEN.\r\n\r\nAS I WAS NEARING MY 80K SERVICE, I CONTACTED MY DEALER AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE MFD AS BEING UNSERVICEABLE THAT NEXT SATURDAY.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE MADE THE COMMENT THAT IT WAS COMMON FOR THE MFD TO GO BAD.  TO REPLACE THE MFD WITH A NEW ONE, IT IS $4,000.00 PLUS INSTALLATION.  THAT IS 19% OF THE COST OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IT WAS BRAND NEW! \r\n\r\nI BEGAN RESEARCHING AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON 10 JANUARY 2005 TITLE: MULTI-DISPLAY FUNCTIONS ARE INOPERATIVE; TSB# EL002-05 WHICH IDENTIFIED ISSUES WITH THE MFD.  ALSO IN BROWSING THE WEB SPECIFICALLY WWW.PRIUSCHAT.COM AND HTTP://AUTOS.GROUPS.YAHOO.COM/GROUP/PRIUS-2G/ AND SAW THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  ONE ELECTRONICALLY GIFTED PERSON DISASSEMBLED HIS MFD AND DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS IMPROPER SOLDERING ON THE CIRCUIT CARD (SEE HTTP://TECHNO-FANDOM.ORG/~HOBBIT/CARS/MFD/COMPARE.HTML ). \r\n\r\nIT SEEMS THAT TOYOTA CORPORATION WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WERE NOT DISCLOSING IT HOPING THAT THE FAULTY MFD?S WOULD NOT BE DISCOVERED UNTIL THE VEHICLES EXCEEDED THE 3 YEAR 36,000 WARRANTY.  I KNOW I AM OUTSIDE THE MILEAGE WARRANTY, HOWEVER, I AM JUST PASSED THE 3 YEAR WINDOW. I PURCHASED AND USE MY CAR AS A COMMUTER VEHICLE DRIVING ALMOST 100 MILES PER DAY.  AS A MAINTENANCE OFFICER IN THE US ARMY, I KNOW THERE ARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE MILEAGE DEPENDENT (ENGINES, TRANSMISSIONS, DIFFERENTIALS) BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.  ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ARE BUILT TO LAST THE MAJORITY OF VEHICLES LIFE, NOT JUST UNTIL THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.  *TR",

THANKFULLY I WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 40MPH WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED TO RED. THE 2 VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME STOPPED. I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND MY CAR ACCELERATED INITIALLY, AND THEN NOTHING. BRAKES ARE MEANT TO WORK. ALWAYS. I KEPT PUMPING THE PEDAL HOPING TO ENGAGE THE BREAKS, BUT THEY DID NOT ENGAGE.  WHAT STOPPED ME WAS THE REAR OF A BMW X5. THANKFULLY I WAS THE ONLY INJURED PARTY, AND MY INJURIES ARE MOSTLY MUSCULAR. I COULD HAVE DIED OR I COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE. IN JANUARY, I HAD TAKING MY CAR TO THE DEALER BECAUSE ALL THE ALERT LIGHTS ON THE DASH WOULD SPORADICALLY GO OFF. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR A WEEK AND CLAIMED THAT THE SECONDARY BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I GOT MY VEHICLE BACK AND ON 2/23/09 THE ISSUE RESTARTED. I WAS DUE TO TAKE MY CAR BACK TO THE DEALER THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT. \r\n \r\nI CALLED A LAWYER TO SEE IF I HAD A CASE, AND WAS TOLD NO. I AM STILL RESEARCHING THE ISSUE BECAUSE SOMEONE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND FUTURE TRAGEDIES SHOULD BE AVOIDED. \r\n \r\nIF ANYONE HAS STARTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT, PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW AS I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN YOU.  *TR\r\n",

I AM THE 3RD OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER BOUGHT IT FROM A REPUTABLE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, WITH THE LOGO \"CERTIFIED USED\" ON THE SALES RECEIPT.  HE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM THE DEALER AFTER THE RECALL NOTICE HAD BEEN PUBLISHED.  IT APPEARS THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT CHECK FOR RECALLS BEFORE \"CERTIFYING\" THIS VEHICLE.

THE INVERTER PUMP THAT SUPPLIES COOLANT TO ALL THE ENGINE PARTS HAD MALFUNCTIONED.  THE MECHANICS TOLD US THAT THE TOYOTA COMPANY WAS AWARE THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD OCCUR ON OUR 05 PRIUS.  IF WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A TOYOTA DEALER THE DEFECTIVE INVERTER PUMP WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A MORE RECENT MODEL FREE OF CHARGE.  THE NEXT DAY WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.

THEIR CODES AS PRINTED ON THEIR INVOICE NUMBER 524093 [21 JULY 2009] ARE \"34352 PULLED CODE POA93, SUB CODE 346-INVERTER COOLING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. FOUND TSB EG001-07 TO CORRECT THIS CONCERN.

SHE CYCLED THE HEADLIGHT \"ON-OFF\" SWITCH AND THE GOOD LEFT HEADLIGHT RELIT.  A FEW MINUTES LATER ALL WENT DARK AGAIN. SHE TURNED THE HEADLIGHT \"ON-OFF \" SWITCH OFF THEN ON, AND THE LEFT HEADLIGHT RELIT.  THIS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL SHE GOT HOME. ON MONDAY, 10-2-09 WE TOOK THE CAR TO SAN LUIS OBISPO TOYOTA FOR REPAIR.  THEY HAD IT TILL 10-5-09,REPLACING THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT, AT A COST OF $528.82.  \r\nON 10-20-09 WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON US101 AT 65 MPH IN THE DARK, THE LEFT HEADLIGHT WENT OUT.  A MOMENT LATER ALL FORWARD LIGHTS WENT OUT.  DUE TO MY WIFE'S PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE, I CYCLED THE HEADLIGHT \"ON-OFF\" SWITCH AND GOT THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT TO RELIGHT.  THIS SUDDEN LOSS OF LIGHTING RECURRED 2 MORE TIMES PRIOR TO THE SUN RISING ENOUGH SO THAT I DID NOT NEED THE HEADLIGHTS.  ON 10-28-09, AFTER RETURNING FROM A TRIP, I HAD THE LEFT HEADLIGHT REPLACED AT MILLER TOYOTA IN ANAHEIM AT A COST OF $362.31.\r\nON BOTH OCCASIONS OF THE LIGHTING FAILURE THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING AT 65MPH, OR APPROX. 100 FEET PER SECOND.  IT TOOK APPROX. 5 TO 10 SECONDS TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFECT AND MAKE A CORRECTION THAT RELIT THE LIGHTS.  THE VEHICLE TRAVELED FROM 500 FEET TO 1000 FEET PER INCIDENT.  FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO COLLISION.  \r\nAT NEITHER TOYOTA DEALER, WERE WE ADVISED THAT THIS WAS A RECURRING PROBLEM ON PRIUS'S, WHICH I FOUND OUT ON-LINE. *TR",

WHEN ONE DRIVES A 2005 PRIUS TOO FAST OVER A SPEED BUMP, OR THROUGH ANOTHER SITUATION WHICH CAUSES THE CAR TO THINK ONE OF ITS WHEELS IS SLIPPING OR SPINNING AT A DIFFERENT RATE THAN THE OTHERS, THE CAR TEMPORARILY (AS I BELIEVE IS IN THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL) FLASHES A BRIEFLY APPEARING INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE FRONT PANEL INDICATING IT IS SLIPPING, AND TEMPORARILY CUTS BACK ON ENGINE POWER.  AVOIDING THIS REQUIRES KNOWING THE DRIVING BEHAVIOR OF THE PRIUS, AND I WONDER IF THIS IS THE BEHAVIOR CERTAIN 2010 PRIUS OWNERS MAY BE NOTING.  {IF ONE IS LOOKING AT THE ROAD AND SCARED BY THE SUDDEN DROP IN ENGINE POWER, ONE MAY NEVER LOOK DOWN AT THE DASH TO SEE THE INDICATOR FLASH FOR 1-2 SECONDS EITHER.}\r\n\r\nNORMALLY THIS IS MIGHT SEEM LIKE REASONABLE, BUT THIS BECOMES POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SHOULD ONE TRY TO MAKE A SHARP RIGHT TURN ONTO A HIGHER-SPEED MAIN ROAD  (40 MPH+) FROM A DEAD STOP ON A SIDE ROAD WITH A HIGH RATE OF ACCELERATION TO ATTEMPT MERGE INTO HIGH-VOLUME, FAST-MOVING TRAFFIC.

FINALLY, I PUSHED DOWN HARD ON THE BRAKES AND GOT THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED IT OFF. I HAVE RUBBER MATS. I THOUGHT ONE OF THEM HAD GONE UNDER THE PEDAL. \"CASE SOLVED\" SO I THOUGHT.\r\nLAST DECEMBER, AGAIN PASSING A TRUCK UPHILL ON ROUTE 840, I FLOORED THE PRUIS GAS PEDAL. THE SAME THING HAPPENED! THIS TIME I KNEW IT WAS NOT THE MAT BECAUSE I HAD DRILLED HOLES IN IT AND ATTACHED IT TO THE MAT POSTS. IT WAS INCHES AWAY FROM THE GAS PEDAL WHEN THIS HAPPENED.\r\nI PUSHED THE BRAKES DOWN HARD AND STRUGGLED THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD RIGHT BEFORE THE LANES MERGED AND THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE CUT ME OFF (INTO A SWAMP). THE BRAKES, WITH A BURNING SMELL, FOUGHT THE RACING CAR. I FINALLY GOT IT TURNED OFF. WHEN I TURNED IT BACK ON, THE GAS WAS STILL RACING! I TURNED IT OFF AGAIN. AFTER WAITING,IT STARTED NORMALLY.\r\nIT HAS DONE IT EVERY TIME THE PEDAL WAS FLOORED(SELDOM).\r\nI WENT TO THE INTERNET AND FOUND THIS HAD BEEN A PROBLEM AND TOYOTA WAS PLANNING A PRIUS RECALL, WITH PARTS TO REPAIR AVAILABLE IN APRIL. \r\nI WAS VERY SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR, BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO SELL IT (WRONG) OR BUY ANOTHER. SO I DECIDED TO WAIT FOR THE RECALL. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON PINS AND NEEDLES SINCE.\r\nAND NOW THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THE PRIUS GAS PEDAL!\r\nI'M GLAD FOR THE BRAKE RECALL BECAUSE MY PRIUS HAS DONE THAT ONCE TOO, BUT FREAKED OUT ABOUT NO STICKING GAS PEDAL RECALL FOR THE PRIUS.\r\nI WENT TO THE DEALER TODAY FOR 115,000K SERVICE AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS.\r\n\"TECHNICIAN CAN NOT REPLICATE PROBLEM\".

DUE TO THE INJURIES I SUFFERED (A MINOR CONCUSSION RESULTING IN RETROGRADE AMNESIA), I HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF THE PERIOD PRIOR TO ARRIVING AT THE INTERSECTION UP UNTIL THE PARAMEDICS REMOVED ME FROM THE VEHICLE. AS SUCH, I CAN'T EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.\r\n\r\nWHILE I HAVE NO PROOF OF THIS, IT SEEMS THAT A POSSIBILITY WOULD BE AN ISSUE WITH THE STUCK ACCELERATOR THAT'S BEING REPORTED RELATING TO THE PRIUS. I'VE BEEN AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN WHY I WOULD HAVE PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC AT AN INTERSECTION THAT I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH. WHEN I HEARD OF THE ACCELERATION ISSUES WITH THE PRIUS, I WONDERED IF THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nSINCE THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED, IT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.

IT HAS BEEN SERVICED AND MAINTAINED AT SCHEDULED INTERVALS, MOSTLY BY A TOYOTA DEALER. #1: I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER SINCE THE FIRST WINTER THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR THAT THE \"TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM\" IS DANGEROUS IN BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS. WHENEVER THE ROAD IS SLIPPERY, IF THE CAR SENSES WHEELSPIN, IT CUTS POWER TO THE ENGINE. THIS IS SCARY IF YOU'RE PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC ON A RAINY DAY, AS THE CAR WILL SOMETIMES JUST QUIT RUNNING FOR A SECOND, LEAVING YOU VULNERABLE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. SNOW IS FAR WORSE. I LIVE ON A HILLY ROAD. IF IT'S SNOWY THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN, AND SIMPLY STOP TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE FIRST STEEP SLOPE I COME TO. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HARD I MASH ON THE ACCELERATOR, OR IF I BACK OFF AND TRY AGAIN, THE CAR WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO MOVE. ONCE THE CAR STOPS MOVING FORWARD IT BEGINS TO SLIDE BACKWARDS, AND CONTROL IS TOTALLY LOST. I WAS NEARLY KILLED THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED (IN ABOUT ONE INCH OF SNOW) AS MY CAR EVENTUALLY SLIPPED SIDEWAYS ACROSS THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE. AN SUV CAME DOWN THE HILL AND NEARLY BROADSIDED ME BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CAR TURNED BACK DOWN THE HILL. (MY CAR WAS EQUIPPED WITH AGGRESSIVE SNOW TIRES AT THE TIME.) EVER SINCE THEN, IF I'M COMING HOME FROM WORK IN THE SNOW, I LEAVE MY CAR IN THE SHOPPING CENTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND CALL MY HUSBAND, WHO PICKS ME UP WITH HIS FORD BRONCO.\r\n# 2: ANTI-LOCK BRAKING. THE 2010 PRIUS'S AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WITH PROBLEMS; MINE DOES THE SAME THING. IF I'M BRAKING ON A BUMPY STRETCH OF ROAD OR OVER A MANHOLE COVER IN THE RAIN, THE CAR WILL CUT POWER TO THE BRAKES, CAUSING THE CAR TO FEEL LIKE IT'S SURGING FORWARD. AGAIN THIS PROBLEM IS MUCH WORSE IN THE SNOW. GOING DOWNHILL ON A SNOWY, SLIPPERY HILL THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES REPEATEDLY CUT BRAKING POWER, WHICH ACTUALLY CAUSES THE CAR TO ACCELERATE TO UNSAFE SPEEDS.\r\nMY DEALER TELLS ME THAT THIS IS HOW THE CAR WORKS, AND NOTHING CAN BE DOME TO CORRECT IT. *TR",

THE FIRST WAS WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON A SIDE-STREET. I WAS GOING SLOW, LESS THEN 15 MILES PER HOUR, AND STEPPED ON THE BRAKES TO MAKE A TURN. THE BRAKES WERE UNRESPONSIVE FOR APROX. 2 SECONDS CAUSING ME TO ROLL BEFORE THE BRAKES ENGAGE. THE SECOND OCCURED WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AT A LOW SPEED, UNDER 40 MILES AN HOUR, ON A MAIN ROAD. AS SHE APPROACHED THE STOPLIGHT SHE STEPPED ON THE BRAKES, WHICH ALSO FAILED TO ENGAGE. DUE TO HER HIGHER SPEED SHE ROLLED OVER 10 FEET AND CAME CLOSE TO HITTING THE CAR STOPPED IN FRONT OF HER BEFORE THE BRAKES FINALLY ENGAGED. THE FINAL OCCURANCE ALSO OCCURED WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING, THIS TIME AT A HIGHER SPEED BETWEEN 40 AND 50 MILES PER HOUR, WHEN PRESSING ON THE BRAKES ON AN OVERPASS THE BRAKES FAILED TO ENGAGE AND THE CAR PHYSICALLY SEEMED TO SHAKE A BIT. AFTER BEING UNABLE TO STOP FOR SEVERAL FEET THE BRAKES FINALLY ENGAGED. WE BELIEVE THESE OCCURANCES ARE DUE TO AN ERROR WITH OUR ABS SYSTEM. IN EACH OCCURANCE THE \"SLIPPERY ROAD\" WARNING HAS APPEARED. WE TOOK IT TO WILDE TAYOTA THIS MORNING.

AS A LIFELONG PROFESSIONAL DRIVER WITH EXPERIENCE OPERATING JUST ABOUT ANYTHING MY FIRST LEARNED REACTION WAS TO DIG MY HEELS IN AND PULL THE FLOOR MAT BACK, IT'S HAPPENED TO ME IN OTHER VEHICLES. I GLANCED DOWN AND THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS AT THE PEDAL. MY SEVERELY DISABLED SON WAS WITH ME. AUTOMATICALLY, I STARTED KICKING THE GAS PEDAL. AFTER SEVERAL KICKS IT SLOWED. NO PROBLEM SINCE. NEVER REPORTED THE INCIDENT. JUST FIGURED A WEIRD GLITCH. HAD NOT TRIED BRAKES YET, NOR NEUTRAL, IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF CAR, A BIT SCARED TO TRY TO TURN IT OFF WHILE GOING DOWN THE ROAD.

THERE WERE CARS PARKED ON EACH SIDE OF ME; I DIDN'T HIT EITHER OF THEM.  I WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE WALL AT THE FONT OF THE PARKING SPACE. NO WATER OR ICE OR BAD CONDITIONS WERE PRESENT.  THE SURGE WAS MUCH FASTER THAN WOULD HAVE OCCURRED HAD I MISTAKENLY HIT THE ACCELERATOR RATHER THAN THE BRAKE. OVER $3300 WORTH OF DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE FRONT OF MY CAR.  MY ANKLE BONE WAS CHIPPED, MY WRIST WAS SORE, I HAD MINOR WHIPLASH. I WAS ALONE IN THE CAR.  I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS WAS NOT A RESULT OF DRIVER ERROR ON MY PART, NOR DO I THINK IT IS A RESULT OF THE FLOOR MAT CATCHING THE ACCELERATOR.  WHAT I EXPERIENCED MATCHES MUCH MORE CLOSELY WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF A FLUKE COMPUTER ERROR CAUSING THE CAR TO SURGE FORWARD WHEN I TOUCHED THE BRAKES.  IT WAS A STRONG, FAST AND SUDDEN SURGE; MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN WHAT I EXPERIENCE WHEN I USE THE ACCELERATOR.  I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO TOYOTA (REFERENCE #200710181201).

      "Summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO FILE AN OFFICIAL REPORT OF MY ACCIDENT THAT INVOLVED MY 2005 TOYOTA PRIUS ON JANUARY 13 OF THIS YEAR.  IT WAS IN THE MORNING AFTER I HAD DROPPED OFF MY CHILDREN TO THEIR SCHOOL.  I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HILL AND DRIVING THE NORMAL 25- 30MPH DOWN THE HILL TO GO HOME.  UPON COMING TO THE STOPLIGHT, I NOTICED THE CARS IN FRONT OF ME STOPPED AT THE STOPLIGHT SO I WENT TO HIT MY BRAKES AND DID NOT FEEL ANY POWER FROM MY BRAKES SO I QUICKLY STOOD ON MY BRAKES WITH BOTH FEET AND REALIZED I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO BRAKE POWER.  I SUBSEQUENTLY CRASHED QUITE HARD INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND EXPERIENCED SEVERE PAIN TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY NECK.  AFTER INITIAL SHOCK, I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER MY CAR OUT OF TRAFFIC TO A PARKING LOT AND NOTICED IT FUNNY  THAT MY BRAKES WERE WORKING AT THAT POINT. \r\n      AFTER EXCHANGING INFORMATION WITH THE MAN THAT I HIT, MY CAR WAS TOWED TO AN AUTOBODY SHOP.  AFTER GOING TO KAISER TO LOOK INTO MY INJURY (WHICH WAS WHIPLASH) I WAS TOLD AT THE AUTOBODY SHOP THAT MY CAR WAS TOTALED AND COULD NOT BE FIXED.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE I HAD HIT A LARGER AMERICAN CAR WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN MY BUMPER.  IT NEVER HIT THE AIRBAG SENSOR ON MY CAR THAT WAS LOWER THAN THE IMPACT POINT.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE ACCIDENT, I  ASKED MY INSURANCE COMPANY, THE INTERINSURANCE EXCHANGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE , TO PLEASE LOOK INTO THE BRAKE SITUATION AND THEY STATED THAT THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ANSWER BECAUSE I HAVE READ THAT THE TOYOTA PROBLEMS ARE NOT EASY TO DIAGNOSE.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 27 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN AUTO CRASH THAT WAS MY FAULT.  I ALSO HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A SCARY FEELING AS HAVING ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER MY CAR. *TR",

I STILL REMEMBER THIS DANGEROUS EVENT VERY CLEARLY. I CAN EASILY REPLICATE THE PROBLEM FOR YOU.\r\n\r\nI WAS ABOUT TO BACK MY PRIUS OUT OF ITS DIAGONAL PARKING SPACE ON A BUSY MAIN STREET IN DOWNTOWN EL CAJON, CA. IT WAS DAYTIME. VEHICLES WERE PARKED ON EITHER SIDE OF ME, WHICH PREVENTED ME FROM SEEING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS TRAFFIC APPROACHING.\r\n\r\nI CAREFULLY BACKED OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE UNTIL I COULD SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS TRAFFIC APPROACHING. I SAW THAT THERE WAS AND IT WAS APPROACHING QUICKLY, SO WITH THE INTENTION OF STOPPING MY CAR¿S BACKWARDS MOVEMENT AND, INSTEAD, GOING FORWARD INTO MY PARKING SPACE, I HIT THE BRAKES AND QUICKLY MOVED THE GEARSHIFT LEVER OVER TO THE LEFT AND FULLY DOWN INTO THE DRIVE GATE TO THE STOP POSITION, BEFORE I RELEASED THE SPRING-LOADED SHIFT LEVER (WHICH SENDS IT BACK TO ITS 'HOME' POSITION). I THEN QUICKLY PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL, INTENDING FOR THE CAR TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT I COULD DRIVE BACK INTO MY PARKING SPACE.\r\n\r\nTO MY SHOCK, MY CAR JUMPED FURTHER BACKWARDS INTO THE TRAFFIC LANE, INSTEAD OF FORWARDS INTO MY PARKING SPACE.\r\n\r\nHAVING GOOD REFLEXES, AND IN SOMEWHAT OF A PANIC NOW, I ONCE AGAIN SHOVED THE GEARSHIFT LEVER FULLY INTO THE DRIVE GATE AND FULLY DOWN UNTIL IT CONTACTED THE STOP, BEFORE LETTING GO OF IT.

ASIDE FROM THE COST ($2250), ITS THE POSSIBILITY THAT I COULD HAVE LOST MY BRAKES ON EITHER OF THE TWO HIGHWAYS THAT I TAKE ON THE WAY HOME, EXIT RAMPS, TOLL BOOTHS, AND THAT I OR SOME OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT, REALLY UPSETS ME.  AND HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS WILL NOT FAIL AGAIN?  REGULAR SERVICE DOES NOT CHECK COMPUTER STATUS.  I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO COMPUTER PROBLEMS WITH TOYOTA AND ALSO WHAT TOYOTA INCLUDES IN REGULAR SERVICE.  THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BEFORE, AND THAT MAY BE TRUE: I HAVE A 5 YR OLD PRIUS WITH MORE THAN 110K MILES ON IT AND I'LL BET THAT  IS A LOT OF MILEAGE FOR A PRIUS.  AS MORE PEOPLE DRIVE PRIUS'S FOR LONGER TIMES AND ACCRUE HIGHER MILEAGE, I WOULD BET THAT TOYOTA WILL SEE A LOT MORE OF THESE INCIDENTS.  I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BE PROACTIVE AND DEAL WITH THIS BEFORE PEOPLE GET HURT. *TR",

I FRANTICALLY HIT BRAKES BUT THE CAR DID NOT STOP AND, IN FACT, SEEMED TO SPEED UP. I AM ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS A FAULT IN THE ACCELERATOR MECHANISM. I, AT FIRST,THOUGHT IT WAS MY FAULT AND SAID SO TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY WITHIN AN HOUR OF THE ACCIDENT. BUT ON REFLECTION, I DECIDED IT WAS THE CAR ITSELF AND THE FOLLOWING DAY I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS A FAULT WITH THE CAR THAT WAS THE CAUSE. I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT TOYOTA CORP. NUMEROUS TIMES BY EMAIL AND HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. FINALLY I CONTACTED THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER WHO WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO RELAY MY EMAIL TO TOYOTA CORP. THE LOCAL DEALER SENT ME AN EMAIL THE FOLLOWING DAY TELLING ME THAT I HAD TO GET AN OFFICIAL CASE OPENED WITH TOYOTA,S CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER AND TO CONTACT THEM AT 1(800)331-4331 TO GET A CASE NUMBER. I HAVE BEEN PHONING THEM FOR WEEKS AND I AM NOT ABLE TO GET ANYTHING BUT A RECORDED MESSAGE. TRYING THE LOCAL DEALER AGAIN, HE CALLED DIRECT AND ASKED THEM TO CALL ME BUT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG WAITING LIST. SO I AM NOW TRYING THE NHTSA. *TR",

ALTHOUGH THE TRUCK'S BRAKE LIGHTS WERE NOT ON, I PERCEIVED THE TRUCK WAS GRADUALLY SLOWING. IN ANTICIPATION OF MAKING A STOP, I MOVED MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.

THATS WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD NO POWER STEERING. THERE WAS AN EXIT COMING UP SO I LET THE CAR SLOW DOWN TO ABOUT 50MPH. AS I STARTED TO EXIT I PUT MY FT ON THE BRAKES. THATS WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE PEDAL WAS VERY STIFF AND VIBRATING. I WAS COMING TO A BLIND INTERSECTION AND I HAD THE RED LITE. SO I PUSHED ON MY BRAKES. INSTANTLY I COULD HEAR SCREACHING TIRES. SO I LOOKED IN MY SIDE MIRROR. AND TO MY SUPRISE IM LOOKING AT A LARGE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM ME! MY REAR TIRES HAD LOCKED UP AND MY FRONT TIRES WERENT DOING ANYTHING.

I SAW CARS AND TRUCKS BARRELING TOWARD ME IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR, UNABLE TO MOVE, AND VISIBILITY GREATLY REDUCED, DUE TO THE FALLING SNOW. I PUT MY BLINKERS ON, AND THANKFULLY ON COMING TRAFFIC WAS ABLE TO AVOID ME. I WAS STUCK AT THIS INTERSECTION FOR FOUR LIGHT CHANGES, SLIGHTLY PANICKED. I FINALLY PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AND GOT JUST ENOUGH MOVEMENT OUT OF THE CAR TO FIND A DRY PATCH AND GET ME MOVING AGAIN.  WHEN I REPORTED THIS TO BOTH TOYOTA, AND MY LOCAL DEALER, THEY TOLD ME THIS IS A \"SAFETY\" FEATURE.  IT'S A SAFETY FEATURE THAT WILL SURELY GET SOMEONE KILLED.  THE FRONT WHEELS SIMPLY WILL NOT SPIN IN THE LEAST IF THE CAR DETERMINES IT IS SLIPPERY, WHICH LEFT ME NO WHERE TO GO AT THAT INTERSECTION. I LATER GOOGLED THE PROBLEM, AND FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH PRIUS OWNERS. A FEW PEOPLE LEFT THE COMMENT THAT SNOW TIRES ARE NECESSARY TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM. NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO,  I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT 4 NEW SNOWTIRES. IT DID MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT FOR SOMEONE ELSE, THEY MAY FIND OUT TOO LATE. THIS SAFETY FEATURE IS AN UNACCEPTABLE DEATH TRAP WAITING TO HAPPEN. *TR",

THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER CAR HAD JUST ARRIVED WITH HIS FARMER¿S MARKET BAGS.    HE SAID HE WOULD TAKE PICTURES SO I WENT BACK TO MY CAR TO GET MY CAMERA TO TAKE PICTURES TOO.  I NOTICED THAT IT WAS MY RIGHT FRONT BUMPER THAT HAD HIT THE OTHER CAR¿S LEFT BACK BUMPER BECAUSE, TRYING TO AVOID HITTING THE OTHER CAR,  I HAD TURNED TOWARD THE STREET.   I TOOK PICTURES OF HIS CAR.  THE OFFICER ARRIVED (CALLED BY THE METER PERSON) AND I GAVE MY REPORT.  THE OFFICER ASKED ME IF I COULD DRIVE MY CAR HOME.  I SAID I WASN'T SURE, I WOULD CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY.  IN ANY CASE I WOULD NOT TRY TO DRIVE RIGHT AWAY AS I WAS TOO SHAKEN.  THE OTHER DRIVER DROVE AWAY.  WHEN THE OFFICER LEFT, I SAT IN MY CAR PASSENGER SIDE WITH MY FEET ON THE SIDEWALK STILL IN SHOCK.  I WAS AFRAID OF DRIVING THE CAR. I CALLED MY SON TO COME TO GET ME. I CALLED THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND FOLLOWED THEIR DIRECTIONS. \r\n\r\nINTENT ON STOPPING THE CAR, I HAD BRAKED AS HARD AS I COULD WITH MY LEFT FOOT.  WHEN WAITING TO TURN THE CAR AROUND I SAW THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS ON. *TR",

THIS SITUATION COULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECTIFIED BY QUICKLY TURNING OFF AND ON AGAIN THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH AT THE STEERING WHEEL STALK.  THEN, ON JULY 24, 2010, WHILE ON A REMOTE AND STEEP WINDING MOUNTAIN PASS ROAD IN CALIFORNIA, (SONORA PASS ROAD) IN PITCH DARK, BOTH HEADLAMPS FAILED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND COULD NOT BE RECTIFIED WITH A QUICK FLICK OF THE HEADLAMP SWITCH OFF AND ON.  I BRAKED HEAVILY, KEEPING IN MY MIND A VISION OF THE CURVE IN THE ROAD I HAD JUST SEEN AHEAD OF ME.  BRAKING HEAVILY AND TRYING TO STEER IN THE DARK, I PUT THE FLASHERS ON SO I WOULDN'T BE REAR-ENDED.  THIS ENDED UP BEING A FORTUITOUS DECISION, BECAUSE IT WAS SO DARK THAT THE MOMENTARY FLASHES OF THE FORWARD FLASHERS ALLOWED ME TO SEE JUST ENOUGH ROAD IN BRIEF SNIPPETS SO THAT I COULD STEER MY VEHICLE SAFELY AROUND THE CURVE AND GET IT OFF THE ROAD.  I FIGURED OUT THAT WITH BOTH LAMPS OUT, A MUCH SLOWER OFF/ON AGAIN CYCLE OF THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH WOULD BRING THEM BACK ON, AND I LIMPED THE VEHICLE HOME. HAVING DRIVEN OVER A MILLION MILES IN MY ADULT LIFE, LUCKILY I HAD THE EXPERIENCE AND THE CALM TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION WITHOUT CATASTROPHIC RESULT.  HAD MY WIFE OR MY DAUGHTER BEEN DRIVING, WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE ROAD AND CRASHED THE VEHICLE.  IMMEDIATELY THE FOLLOWING DAY I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER; END RESULT OF WHICH THEY WANT ME TO PAY NEARLY $900 TO REPLACE THESE DEFECTIVE HEADLAMPS.  I CALLED TOYOTA, AND UPON INITIAL CONTACT, WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR US.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IN THIS ECONOMY, WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY, AND WE HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO DRIVING OUR PRIUS MOSTLY DAYTIMES, AND CERTAINLY NOT ON MOUNTAIN PASS ROADS AT NIGHT.

PASSENGER DOOR COULDN'T OPEN UNTIL FIREFIGHTERS PRIED IT OPEN.  CALLED TOYOTA, FILED A CLAIM ON DEFECTIVE AIRBAG.  MY RESPONSE WAS THEY WEREN'T GOING FAST ENOUGH(ONLY OVER 30 MPH) FOR THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY, THEY WEREN'T HIT HARD ENOUGH AND THE DASHBOARD MUST NOT HAVE LOOSENED FROM THE CAR OR ELSE AIRBAGS WOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  MY DAUGHTER TOOK THE BLUNT OF IT.  BODY FLEW FORWARD (SHE HAD A SEATBELT ON)  HAND HIT DASHBOARD, KNEES HIT GLOVE COMPARTMENT SO HARD THAT IT POPPED OPEN.

SYMPTOMS OBSERVED AT ANY SPEED, BUT ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE AT SLOW SPEEDS (COMING TO A FINAL STOP, SUCH AS AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, OR IN REVERSE BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY).  WHEN APPLYING BRAKES AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, JERKINESS FELT LIKE ALTERNATE OVER BRAKING / UNDER BRAKING.  SYMPTOMS WERE QUITE SCARY THE FIRST TIMES IT HAPPENED.\r\n\r\nHAD PERSONAL MECHANIC CHECK OUT BRAKES.

SINCE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT, WE DECIDED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM CONTINUED INTERMITTENTLY, GRADUALLY INCREASING IN FREQUENCY TO THE POINT IN THE LAST MONTH WHERE IT WAS HAPPENING MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.  TOOK CAR TO TOYOTA DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS.   PROBLEM WAS NOT EVIDENT ON DAY OF SERVICE.  THEY CHECKED COMPUTER FOR STORED ERROR CODES, AND FOUND NONE.  REAR BRAKE DRUMS SHOWED SLIGHT WEAR AND WERE OUT OF ADJUSTMENT, SO DRUMS WERE CLEANED AND TURNED AND BRAKES ADJUSTED.  NO DIFFERENCE IN OBSERVED BEHAVIOR; BY END OF THE NEXT DAY, JERKY BEHAVIOR NOTED AS BAD AS IT HAD EVER BEEN.\r\n\r\nTOOK CAR BACK TO DEALER.

A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DECOUPLED COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY INSTALLED ON THE SPLINE OUTPUT OF THE POWER ASSIST COLUMN, WHICH ALLOWED A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ON THE INTERIOR OF THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWED SEPARATION OF THE SHAFT FROM THE ELECTRICAL STEERING POWER ASSIST COLUMN.

I CAN BEST DESCRIBE IT AS BEING A VISCOUS BLACK GLOB LIKE ROOFING TAR. TO OPEN THE HATCH, YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THIS BLACK GOO EACH TIME, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE THE HATCH RELEASE. WE BELIEVE THIS MELTING PROCESS STARTED AT ABOUT THE 2 YR. MARK. I THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A SINGULAR ISSUE, BUT HAVE FOUND THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO SEVERAL CAR OWNERS, . TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS, AND IS SELLING THE ENTIRE WIRING HARNESS FOR $96 PLUS REPAIR COSTS, AND HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT RECALLING THIS. FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, THIS MEANS YOU CAN EXPERIENCE EXTREME DIFFICULTY OPENING THE REAR HATCH (A LIFE SAFETY ACCESS POINT), AND WILL GET STICKY BLACK TAR ON YOU FROM THE MELTED DOWN RUBBER COVER OF THE EXTERIOR HATCH RELEASE HANDLE. TO ME, THIS IS BOTH A SERIOUS LIFE SAFETY ISSUE AND A SERIOUS QUALITY DEFECT THAT TOYOTA IS OPTING TO IGNORE AND ONLY FIXING ON VEHICLES WITH EXTENDED WARRANTIES, SINCE THE FAILURE APPEARS TO OCCUR AT AROUND THE 3 YEAR MARK (IE AFTER 3 YEARS OF EXPOSURE TO THE BRIGHT SUN IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR EXAMPLE). I AM AWARE OF THE OUTSTANDING WORK DONE BY NHTSA ON OTHER SAFETY ISSUES, INCLUDING THE PROBLEM WITH RUSTY FRAMES ON 02 ISUZU AXIOMS, AND I FIND THIS PROBLEM TO BE SIMILAR IN NATURE, SO I AM ASKING FOR YOUR AGENCY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE INSTANCES AND ALSO TO INQUIRE FROM TOYOTA WHY THEY ARE NOT RECALLING THESE HANDLES THAT ARE MELTING IN THE SUN!!! IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I THINK A DOOR HANDLE OR HATCH HANDLE SHOULD BE MADE TO LAST MORE THAN 3 YEARS.  *TR",

THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO MY CAR (MY LICENSE PLATE HOLDER HIT HER BUMPER AND CAUSED A COUPLE OF PAINT CHIPS ON HERS, WHICH WILL PROBABLY COST ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPAIR) BUT I CAN TELL YOU I WAS THOROUGHLY SHAKEN UP. NO EMERGENCY LIGHTS OR CODE LIGHTS WENT ON INSIDE THE CAR. FROM READING OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE, I SEE THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM. I WILL BE REPORTING THIS TO MY TOYOTA DEALER AND TO TOYOTA.   *TR",

FORTUNATELY, THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT, AND WAS ABLE TO GRADUALLY STOP THE VEHICLE BY PRESSING ON THE BRAKE AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. THE BRAKING DISTANCE FELT A LOT FURTHER THAN USUAL. AFTER COMING TO A STOP AND WAITING A FEW MINUTES, STOPPED AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE. THE HIGH PITCH NOISE STOPPED ONCE THE ENGINE TURNED OFF. ONCE THE ENGINE WAS BACK ON, THE BRAKE PEDAL FELT NORMAL AGAIN, AND WHILE THE ABS LIGHT WAS NO LONGER ILLUMINATED, THE RED WARNING LIGHT REMAINED ON. TOOK THE CAR IMMEDIATELY TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE MY CAR IS NORMALLY SERVICED, AND THEY INDICATED THERE WAS A FAULT CODE C1300 AND RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE SKID CONTROL ECU (PART# 89540-47130).

THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT WAS DECOUPLED FROM THE ELECTRIC- POWER- ASSIST COLUMN OUTPUT SPLINE. A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE DECOUPLED COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY INSTALLED ON THE SPLINE OUTPUT OF THE POWER ASSIST COLUMN.  THIS ALLOWED A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ON THE INTERIOR OF THE UPPER STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWED SEPARATION OF THAT SHAFT FROM THE ELECTRICAL STEERING POWER ASSIST COLUMN.

      "Summary": "WHEN I STARTED MY 2005 TOYOTA PRIUS, I GOT A WARNING ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAY THAT THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT LEVELING SYSTEM HAD MALFUNCTIONED. THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT CORRECTS THE AIM OF THE HEADLIGHTS IF YOU ARE DRIVING WITH AN UNUSUALLY HEAVY LOAD, SO THAT YOUR LIGHTS DO NOT MOMENTARILY BLIND ONCOMING DRIVERS. UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN THE SENSOR IN THE HEADLIGHT LEVELING SYSTEM FAILS, THE HEADLIGHTS AIM THEMSELVES TO A DEFAULT POSITION THAT IS UNSAFE; THE HEADLIGHTS AIM DOWNWARDS, AND ILLUMINATE THE GROUND 20 FEET IN FRONT OF THE CAR AND NO FARTHER. IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IN THE DARK FASTER THAN 20 MILES AN HOUR WITH THE HEADLIGHTS LIKE THIS. THE PROBLEM BEGINS WITH THE SENSOR IN THE 2004 AND 2005 MODEL PRIUSES, WHERE A GASKET FAILS AND THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THE SENSOR CORRODE AND FAIL. TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND NOW OFFERS IMPROVED REPLACEMENT PARTS AND HAS ISSUED THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN BELOW. HOWEVER, REPLACING THIS PART AT A DEALER CAN COST UPWARDS OF $500, DISCOURAGING MANY OWNERS FROM MAKING THE REPAIR, LEADING TO UNSAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR PRIUS DRIVERS AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD. THERE IS NO MANUAL OVERRIDE TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR A DRIVER TO DRIVE IN THE DARK. IT SEEMS LIKE POOR ENGINEERING THAT TOYOTA HAS IMPLEMENTED A SAFETY DEVICE THAT, WHEN IT FAILS, CREATES A MORE UNSAFE CONDITION THAN IF THE SAFETY DEVICE WERE NOT THERE. NOT TO BE OVERLY DRAMATIC, BUT IT WAS A FAILED GASKET AND FAILED SENSORS THAT BROUGHT DOWN THE SPACE SHUTTLE. A REPAIR SUGGESTED ONLINE INVOLVES SPRINGS FROM BALLPOINT PENS, BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

IT BEGAN HAPPENING ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND NOW HAPPENS EVERY TIME I START THE CAR. IT ALSO BEGAN HAPPENING AT STOPLIGHTS AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ACCELERATE ONTO A FAST HIGHWAY FROM A STOPLIGHT LAST WEEK.  IT TAKES UP TO 10 ATTEMPTS TO KEEP IT IN DRIVE OR REVERSE NOW FROM A STOPPED POSITION, AND I NEVER KNOW WHEN OR FOR HOW LONG IT WILL HAPPEN. OTHER THAN THIS, MY CAR IS IN GOOD CONDITION AND HAS NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS. I LOOKED UP THE ISSUE ONLINE, AND FROM WHAT A LOT OF OTHER PRIUS DRIVERS SAY, IT SOUNDS LIKE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY (SEE BELOW FOR LINKS TO FORUMS WHERE MANY OTHERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE).  THIS FIX COSTS A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS, AND IT SEEMS COMMON IN THE 2004-2009 PRIUS.  IT HAS A TSB OUT ON IT (SEE LINK BELOW), SO THE ISSUE IS KNOWN?BUT THIS PART SHOULD BE ISSUED A RECALL FOR THOSE HAVING ISSUES!!

      "Summary": "BOUGHT ONE-OWNER 2005 PRIUS 11-26-2014 AFTER PAYING FOR A PRE-PURCHASE INSPECTION AT A TOYOTA DEALER SHOWING COMPLETE SERVICE RECORD INCLUDING ALL RECALL CAMPAIGNS. 4-19-2015 WITHOUT WARNING ON THE EXPRESSWAY, THE ENTIRE 'COMBINATION METER DISPLAY' SIMPLY TURNED OFF, LEAVING THE CAR RUNNING IN THE BLIND, NO GAUGES/METERS/GUIDANCE OF ANY KIND. THE CAR CONTINUED TO OPERATE AND I DROVE DIRECTLY HOME AND PARKED IT. INTERNET SEARCH REVEALED THAT THIS AS A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE BY TOYOTA AFFECTING 2004-2009 PRIUS MODELS. TOYOTA ISSUED A 'WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT-ZTV' AND WARRANTY POLICY BULLETIN (BULLETIN NO. POL12-05) TO EFFECT THE NECESSARY SAFETY REPAIRS, BUT ONLY APPLIES IF ONE DISCOVERS (MEANING SUFFER THE PANIC OF HAVING THE ENTIRE PANEL GO BLANK) THE ISSUE BEFORE EITHER '9 YEARS WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITATION OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 30, 2013', WHICHEVER IS LONGER. IN OUR CASE, IT EXPIRED JUST BEFORE OUR PRE-PURCHASE INSPECTION/PURCHASE OF THE PRIUS AND THE DEALER INDICATED/TOYOTA CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A TOYOTA DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD HAVE DISCOVERED THROUGH TOYOTA RECORDS. INSTEAD, THE OWNER HAS TO WAIT FOR THE FAILURE TO OCCUR. IN OUR CASE, TOYOTA CORPORATE, WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SAFETY DEFECT, SAID OUR JOINT 'PLAN OF ACTION' WAS (A) IF THE DISPLAY DOES NOT ILLUMINATE, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DRIVE THE CAR, AND HAVE IT TOWED TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR NECESSARY REPAIRS, OR (B) IF THE DISPLAY ILLUMINATES, IMMEDIATELY DRIVE IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR NECESSARY REPAIRS, BUT THAT (C) TOYOTA WOULD 'DECLINE TO FURTHER PARTICIPATE OR CONTRIBUTE' TO THE REPAIR. \r\n\r\nTHIS SHOULD BE A MANDATED, REQUIRED SAFETY RECALL; BY ITS OWN MEASURE, UP TO 669,000 PRIUS MODELS MAY BE AT RISK TO THIS KNOWN DEFECT, YET TOYOTA REFUSES BOTH THE RECALL AND THE REPAIR.

THEY DID SO AND SAID THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY A FAULTY LIGHT AND REPLACED IT.  IT IS A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW AND THE SAME LIGHT IS GOING OUT AGAIN.  WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN I TURN THE CAR ON AND TURN ON ALL OF THE CAR LIGHTS TO DRIVE IT AT NIGHT, THEY TURN ON, BUT ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD AND UNBEKNOWNST TO ME, THE RIGHT PASSENGER LIGHT GOES OUT.  BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF THE CAR, YOU CANNOT TELL THAT IT IS OUT.  THE ONLY REASON I KNEW IT WAS OUT AGAIN WAS BECAUSE I GOT PULLED OVER AND GIVEN A TICKET.  THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND I HAVE READ A NUMBER OF SIMILAR OCCURRENCES ONLINE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND THEY HAVE SAID (AFTER LOOKING ONLINE) THAT THE ISSUE IS THE \"HEADLIGHT LIGHT CONTROL ECU SUB-ASSEMBLY\".  BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY RISK THIS POSSES TO THE DRIVER AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD, NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF THE SINGLE ITEM TO REPAIR IT, TOYOTA SHOULD MAKE APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS TO THOSE HAVING THIS TROUBLE.

I HAD TURN SIGNAL LIGHTS, BUT NOTHING ELSE UNLESS I TURNED OFF THE HEADLIGHTS.  THIS WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS I WAS DRIVING HOME AFTER DARK.  I HAD NO IDEA HOW FAST I WAS GOING, WHAT GEAR I WAS IN, IF I HAD ENOUGH GAS TO GET HOME, ETC., ETC.

I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE ENGINE FINALLY TURNED OFF, BUT THE DISPLAY PANEL WAS STILL DIMLY LIT. I THEN DROVE DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE WHATEVER WAS WRONG REPAIRED.  AFTER A MECHANIC CHECKED IT OUT, IT WAS DETERMINED THE COMPUTER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART.  THIS IS NOT AN ITEM THAT IS NORMALLY SERVICED AND I HAVE NO CLUE IF THE DEALERSHIP CHECKS IT DURING A SERVICING OF THE CAR. SO I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON IT.  IN CHECKING ON THIS WEBSITE I FIND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM AND THAT I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A RECALL ON IT.

LETTERS WERE SENT OUT TO PRIUS OWNERS OF CARS FROM 2004 TO CERTAIN 2009 MODELS.

AFTER THE POLICEMAN CHECKED MY LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, HE INFORMED ME THAT ONE OF MY HEADLIGHTS WAS OUT.  HE ASKED ME TO TRY AND FLICK ON AND OFF THE LIGHTS A COUPLE OF TIMES, AND TO TRY THE BRIGHTS, BUT NONE OF THIS BROUGHT IT BACK INTO WORKING ORDER.

THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT IN MANY OF THEIR VEHICLES. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT A FULL-ON RECALL. THIS FAULTY PART IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT CAN LEAD TO A TOTAL LOSS OF BRAKING ON THE VEHICLE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR USED JUST A MONTH AGO AND AM NOW DEALING WITH AN EXTREMELY COSTLY REPAIR BILL TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THE PREVIOUS OWNER APPARENTLY DID NOT BRING THE CAR IN FOR REPAIR DURING THE SO CALLED WARRANTY TIME FRAME AND NOW I AM DEALING WITH IT. TOYOTA HAS SAID IF THE COMPONENT DIDNT FAIL DURING THE WARRANTY TIMEFRAME, THEN THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR COST. I FEEL TOYOTA WAS TRYING TO AVOID THE REPAIR COSTS AND NOW WANT ME, THE CONSUMER, TO COVER IT OUT OF POCKET. NEEDS TO BE AN IMMEDIATE RECALL ON THIS!\r\n",
