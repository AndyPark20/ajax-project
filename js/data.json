AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE ENGINE WAS NOT GETTING FUEL.  WE EVENTUALLY WERE ASSISTED BY AN IOWA STATE PATROL OFFICER WHO TOOK ME BACK TO THE CASEY'S STATION IN WILLIAMSBURG WHERE I BOUGHT A GASOLINE CAN AND ABOUT 3.5 GALLONS OF FUEL.

I HAD NOT PUT ALL OF THE GAS IN THE CAN INTO MY CAR, AND THE MANUAL STATES THAT THE INDICATOR WILL NOT COME ON WHEN THE TANK IS HOLDING 4.5 GALLONS OF FUEL, SO THERE WAS CLEARLY A GALLON OR MORE OF FUEL IN THE TANK WHEN IT DIED.  ALSO, THAT SECTION OF EASTBOUND I-80 IS SLIGHTLY UPHILL.

WE HAVE A 2010 HONDA CIVIC THAT WAS UNDER THE SNOW FOR 6 WKS. AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP.  SUBARU CHECKED OUR BATTERY, PRONOUNCED IT HEALTHY, SUGGESTED WE BUY A TRICKLE CHARGER (WHICH WE HAVE DONE), AND SENT US $100 FOR OUR LOYALTY.  NOWHERE IN THE SUBARU LITERATURE DOES IT SAY THAT THE CAR MUST BE STARTED EVERY FEW DAYS OR WARN ABOUT BATTERY DRAINAGE.

THE IMPACT WAS BARELY NOTICIBLE. I WAS GOING ABOUT 45 MILES AN HOUR. AFTER INSPECTING THE WINDSHEILD, I NOTICED A SUPER TINY PIT WHERE A MINISCULE PEBBLE MUST HAVE HIT THE WINDOW. IN THE MORNING THE TINY PIT TURNED INTO A FULL ON CRACK EXTENDING HALF WAY DOWN THEN CURVING MIDWAY TOWARDS THE DRIVER SIDE. I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH MY INSURANCE AND THEY REPLACED IT.  IT WOULD HAVE COST ME 625.00. I PAID THE 50.00 DEDUCTIBLE. THE DEALER WOULD NOT COVER THE WINDSHEILD.  IT WAS REPLACED WITH AN OEM SUBARU WINDSHEILD.  THIS WAS HIGHLY IRREGULAR.  NEVER IN ALL MY YEARS OF DRIVING HAS A SMALL PEBBLE, THE PIT SIZE OF A MILLIMETER CAUSED THIS KIND OF DAMAGE.  I THOUGHT IT MUST BE A FLUKE UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN LAST NIGHT WHILE DRIVING HOME ON THE FREEWAY. I HEARD A POP AND THEN ANOTHER POP.  IT SOUNDED LIKE IT CAME FROM UNDER MY CAR.  SOON I SAW A CRACK COMING RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF MY WINDSHEILD.  AFTER INSPECTING IT THIS MORNING, IT WAS CAUSED BY ANOTHER SUPER TINY PEBBLE AS THERE IS A SMALL PIT LESS THAN A MILLIMETER IN SIZE AT THE MIDDLE TOP OF MY WINDSHEILD.  2 WINDSHEILDS IN 7 MONTHS!  THIS IS RIDUCLOUS. THIS QUALITY OF THE WINDSHEILD IS SUBSTANDARD TO NOT HANDLE THE IMPACT OF TINY PEBBLES.  IN ALL MY YEARS OF DRIVING MANY TYPES OF VEHICLES WITH WINDSHEILDS HIT BUT MUCH LARGER ROCKS HAS THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM OCCURED.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFTEY CONCERN.  THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.",

I HAVE TRIED TO RESOLVE THIS WITH SUBARU TO NO AVAIL. HERE IS A SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nON AUGUST 31, 2018 I HAD BEEN DRIVING AT FREEWAY SPEED FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. THE TRIP COMPUTER SAID I HAD 70 MILES TILL EMPTY BUT THE LOW FUEL LIGHT HAD NOT COME ON. THE CAR BEHAVED AS IF IT HAD RUN OUT OF GAS. THE ENGINE REVÂ’D LIKE IT SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR, THEN COMPLETELY QUIT. ZERO WARNING.\r\n\r\nFOR THE NEXT 90 MINUTES I WOULD TRY TO START THE CAR EVERY 20 MINUTES OR SO. THE ENGINE WOULD TURN, BUT NO INDICATION IT WAS GETTING ANY FUEL. I LOOKED AT SEVERAL FORESTER BLOGS AND FOUND MANY IDENTICAL INCIDENTS (HIGHWAY SPEED, LESS THAN A QUARTER TANK, ENGINE REVS THEN DIES). ONE POST SAID THAT AFTER FILLING THE TANK IT WOULD START. A TOW TRUCK TOOK ME TO A GAS STATION WHERE I FILLED IT WITH ~13.5 GALLONS OF GAS. THAT MEANS THE TANK HAD ABOUT 2.4 GALLONS LEFT AND @30MPG=72 MILES JUST LIKE THE TRIP COMPUTER SAID. THATÂ’S ALL I DID, AND THE CAR STARTED IMMEDIATELY.\r\n\r\nMY LOCAL SUBARU DEALER HAD THE CAR FOR A FEW WEEKS AND WORKED WITH SUBARU TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THEY DETECTED AN ERROR WITH THE FUEL PRESSURE SENDING UNITS AND REPLACED THEM. STILL DURING MULTIPLE TEST DRIVES AFTER THE SENSORS WERE REPLACED THEIR TECHNICIAN HAD THE EXACT SAME FAILURE AS I DID.\r\n\r\nON JANUARY 2, 2019 IT DIED ON ME AGAIN. GOING 60 MPH ON A TWO-LANE HIGHWAY WITH 40 MILES TILL EMPTY.\r\n\r\nTHE DEALER THEN HAD THE CAR FOR OVER A MONTH AND CONSULTED WITH SUBARU AGAIN. THEY TEST DROVE IT FOR NEARLY 300 MILES WITH SPECIAL INSTRUMENTS ATTACHED BUT COULDN'T GET THE PROBLEM TO HAPPEN AGAIN. THEY FINALLY RETURNED IT TO ME BUT COULD NOT DETERMINE A ROOT CAUSE.\r\n\r\nSEARCHING THE INTERNET, YOU CAN FIND MANY REPORTS FROM OTHER OWNERS OF EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH SIMILAR VINTAGE SUBARU FORESTERS.",

I BOUGHT MY CAR USED IN SEPTEMBER 2017.  I WAS NEVER INFORMED THAT THERE WERE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH TRANSMISSION PERFORMANCE AND FAILURES.  A TRANSMISSION FAILURE ON A HIGHWAY COULD RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.  AND YET THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL.  I HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO NOTICE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION- JERKING WHILE TRYING TO BRAKE AND DELAYED TURNOVER BETWEEN 2 AND 3RD GEAR.  CONSUMERS WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS I FOUND IT ONLINE.

      "Summary": "WHILE COMPLETING A TIRE ROTATION, I PLACED THE SPARE TIRE ON THE HUB AS A PLACEHOLDER WHILE I MOVED ON TO OTHER WHEELS. I HAND TIGHTENED THE LUGNUTS HOLDING THE SPARE ON (NO WRENCH, NO OVER TORQUEING). I LEFT THE DRIVER FRONT JACKED UP SUPPORTED BY A JACK STAND WHILE I COMPLETED THE REST OF THE TIRE ROTATION; THE SPARE WAS NEVER LOWERED TO THE GROUND AND WEIGHTED, IT WAS SIMPLY INSTALLED AS A BACKUP TO MY JACK STAND. WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE DRIVER FRONT TO REMOVE THE SPARE AND INSTALL THE NORMAL WHEEL, 2 OF THE 5 LUGNUTS THAT I HAD HAND TIGHTENED SEIZED. WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THEM AFTER APPLICATION OF PENETRATING OIL, TWO OF THE STUDS SNAPPED RENDERING THE CAR ENTIRELY UNSAFE TO DRIVE. WHEN I WENT AROUND THE CAR WITH A TORQUE WRENCH SET TO THE MANUAL SPECIFIED TORQUE OF 89 FT/LBS A THIRD STUD STRIPPED. \r\n\r\nI DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE STUDS TO SNAP OR STRIP. I DID NOT OVER TORQUE THE LUGNUTS, THEY WERE HAND TIGHTENED LESS THAN 30 MINUTES PRIOR. THERE IS NO REASON FOR HAND TIGHTENED LUGNUTS TO SEIZE ON A WHEEL STUD AND CAUSE THE LUGNUTS TO SNAP OTHER THAN DEFICIENCY OR WEAKNESS OF THE WHEEL STUD. I HAVE NEVER OVER TORQUED THE WHEELS; I ALWAYS USE A TORQUE WRENCH SET TO 89FT/LBS AS SPECIFIED IN THE OWNERÂ’S MANUAL TO TIGHTEN THE LUGNUTS. I DID NOT CROSS THREAD THE LUGNUTS; I RAN THEM DOWN BY HAND TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE CORRECTLY INSTALLED. MY RESEARCH ON VARIOUS SUBARU ONLINE FORUMS SUGGESTED THAT THE WHEEL STUDS COMMONLY FAIL AND MANY USERS SUGGESTED REPLACING ALL WHEEL STUDS WITH AFTERMARKET HARDENED RACING STUDS RATHER THAN INSTALLING NEW OEM PARTS.\r\n\r\nWHEN I CONTACTED SUBARU I RECEIVED THE RESPONSE \"SUBARU APPRECIATES YOUR TIME IN COMMUNICATING WITH US, HOWEVER WE DO NOT INVESTIGATE EVERY CONCERN THAT IS REPORTED TO US.\"\r\n\r\n",

AT TWO POINTS THAT I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE (ROUGHLY 50000 AND 80000), I HAVE HAD OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS RUN ON THE VEHICLE, BOTH WERE RETURNED AS NORMAL, AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF OIL CONSUMED BY THE ENGINE WAS WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE DESIGN.  ON 24 MAY 2019, I TURNED THE VEHICLE IN TO A SUBARU DEALERSHIP IN HAWAII FOR SERVICING (HAVE USED THIS LOCATION IN THE PAST), AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE OIL IS LEAKING INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM INSIDE THE ENGINE, AND THAT THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE PULLED AND THE UPPER OIL PAN SEALS AND HEAD GASKETS NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS ISSUE COULD GO UNDIAGNOSED FOR THE ENTIRETY THAT I HAVE BEEN HAVING THE VEHICLE SERVICED AT SUBARU DEALERSHIPS, THROUGH TWO OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS, AND JUST NOW THE ISSUE WAS DIAGNOSED.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMOUNT OF OIL MISSING FROM THE PAN MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN \"CONSUMED\" AS THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN MADE A POINT TO STATE, BUT I WOULD SAY A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR OF AN ISSUE WITH THE OIL SYSTEM, IS THE SYSTEM LOSING OIL.  ALSO, AFTER A CURSORY SEARCH OF INTERNET FORUMS, THIS ISSUE SEEMS TO BE A COMMON TREND AMONG SUBARU FORESTERS, AND THE SYMPTOMS WERE COVERED IN A SIMILAR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB NO. 02-157-14R), WHICH INCLUDES MY YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL, BUT DIFFERS IN THAT IT ONLY COVERS THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION CARS, NOT VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH THE CVT.",

THEY TOLD ME THEY CANÂ’T REPAIR ANYTHING SINCE THEY CANÂ’T DETERMINE WHAT IS WRONG - DEEMING MY WARRANTY USELESS FOR THIS ISSUE. I TRIED TO GET BUY BACK FROM SUBARU OF AMERICA. THEY WILL NOT DO A BUYBACK BECAUSE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN REPAIR ORDERS. I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THE CAR SINCE FEB 11, 2019. IT IS A DANGEROUS CAR. IT WILL FAIL AGAIN ON THE FREEWAY AND WHOEVER IS AROUND IS IN DANGER OF INJURY OR DEATH. THE DEALERSHIP WANTS ME TO PICK UP THE CAR. THE FORESTER HAS 58000 MILES WHEN IT LAST FAILED.\r\n",

THE HORN NOW FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\nTHE SUBARU SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT A MISPLACED FUSE (#8 - BACKUP) CAUSED FAILURE OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS.  THEY IMPLIED THAT I HAD MISPLACED THE FUSE - I DID NOT - I CHECKED ONLY THE HORN AND RADIO FUSES.  NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS TO MY VEHICLE.\r\n\r\nI HAVE LEARNED THAT SUBARU RECALLED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER MODELS OF THEIR VEHICLES IN 2010 DUE TO FAULTY SRCS.

WHEN I SAW IT, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT ABOUT ONE HALF COIL TURN ON THE BOTTOM WAS TOTALLY DETACHED (PHOTO).  SHEEHY PROVIDED AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF $1,900 TO REPLACE BOTH OF THE BACK COILS/STRUTS AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE 3-4 DAYS. I DID SOME INTERNET SEARCHING AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OVER THE LAST YEAR-SOME PICS WERE IDENTICAL TO MINE.  THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY COILS THAT HAVE BROKEN, THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF COILS NATIONWIDE. BASED ON WHAT I SAW ON-LINE, I POINTED OUT TO THE SHEEHY SERVICE PERSON THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND I ASKED IF SUBARU WOULD COVER THE COST. HE ASKED AND HEARD BACK WITHIN AN HOUR THAT SUBARU WOULD PAY FOR THE RIGHT BROKEN COIL AS A GOOD WILL GESTURE, BUT IÂ’D HAVE TO PAY FOR THE OTHER ONE, ESTIMATED AT $920.  SINCE SHEEHY ADVISED ME THAT MY CAR WAS Â“NOT SAFE TO DRIVEÂ” (SEE P. 3 OF ATT. RECEIPT) BECAUSE OF THE BROKEN COIL, I AUTHORIZED SHEEHYÂ’S TO MAKE THE REPAIR AND WAS GIVEN A LOANER. 5 DAYS LATER, I HADNÂ’T HEARD ANYTHING SO I CALLED AND WAS ADVISED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM GETTING REPLACEMENT COILS.  IN THE END, IT TOOK 2 AND Â½ WEEKS FOR SHEEHY TO OBTAIN THE COILS AND REPAIR MY VEHICLE ON JULY 15, 2019. WHILE IÂ’M NOT AN EXPERT, GIVEN HOW COMMON THIS DEFECT OCCURS, ITÂ’S FAIRLY CLEAR TO ME TO THAT THERE IS EITHER A MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN A LARGE NUMBER OF COILS, OR THE COIL HAS A DESIGN DEFECT.  IÂ’M NOT SURE WHICH IT IS BUT IT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON A BROADER BASIS.  THE NEW COIL DOES HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DESIGN WITH A PROTECTIVE SLEEVE ON THE BOTTOM FEW TURNS OF THE COIL, WHICH MAY INDICATE A DESIGN DEFECT.

SINCE THE REPAIR OF THE RECALL, I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR BACK TO INTERNATIONAL SUBARU IN TINLEY PARK, IL FOR FOLLOW UP SERVICE RELATED TO THE REPLACEMENT PART.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM I'VE ENCOUNTERED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS IS THE CAR ALERTS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE STATING \"HILL START ASSIST SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE CHECKED\" WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION.  THE CAR THEN CUTS ALL THROTTLE CAPABILITIES FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 SECONDS AND THE CAR JUST COASTS BEFORE RESUMING TAKING A THROTTLE INPUT.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE CAR IS JUST COASTING AND DROPS 15+ MPH IN SPEED.  THIS ALERT SEEMS TO BE TRIGGERED RANDOMLY AND IT CAUSES SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS WHEN WITHOUT WARNING MY CAR SUDDENLY LOSES ANY USAGE OF THE THROTTLE.\r\n\r\nTHIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN TRACED BACK TO THE PART REPLACED IN THE RECALL AND THE DEALER FOUND THE RECORDS IN THE CAR'S COMPUTER SHOWING THE SWITCH WAS ACTIVE WHEN IT WASN'T BEING PRESSED.\r\n\r\nTHIS ISSUE FIRST SURFACED ON 8/31/20 BUT HAS COME BACK NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE THEN.\r\n\r\nFURTHERMORE, I HAD ISSUES WHERE THE BRAKE LIGHTS WERE ON ON THE CAR OVERNIGHT WITH THE SWITCH ACTIVE WITH NO INPUT CAUSING A DRAINED BATTERY.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE THAN JUST LIGHTS BECAUSE THE CAR'S THROTTLE CUTS OUT WITHOUT WARNING AND THIS HAS BEEN TRACED BACK TO THE SWITCH ON MY CAR.

COULDN'T RESTART THE CAR.  HAD IT TOWED TO TULSA DEALERSHIP.  MECHANIC SAID IT WAS BAD/DIRTY GASOLINE.  THE TORQUE CONVERTER ON THE CVT TRANSMISSIONS APPARENTLY MAY ALSO BE A CAUSE.  FORBES MAG RECENTLY DID A ARTICLE ON THIS PROBLEM.  MY CAR YEAR/MODEL WAS INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLE, WHICH ALSO MENTIONED THAT FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE RECEIVED 100 COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS.  I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL RECEIVE A LETTER FROM SUBARU OR WHAT MY NEXT STEP IS.  I PLAN ON SHOWING THE FORBES ARTICLE TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL FORCE ANY ACTION.",
